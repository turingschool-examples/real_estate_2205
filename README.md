## Iteration 1

Start with the three existing tests, and then use TDD to create a `Room` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/room'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️  pry(main)> room = Room.new(:bedroom, 10, "13")
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fa53b9ca0a8 @category=:bedroom, @length=10, @width="13">

⬜️ pry(main)> room.category
⬜️ #=> :bedroom

⬜️ pry(main)> room.area
⬜️ #=> 130

⬜️ pry(main)> room.is_painted?
⬜️ #=> false

⬜️ pry(main)> room.paint

⬜️ pry(main)> room.is_painted?
⬜️ #=> true
```

## Iteration 2

Use TDD to create a `House` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

* Note: Where you see something like `#<House:0x00007fccd30375f8...>`, this is shorthand for a full house object with that object identifier - we have replaced any attributes with `...` for readability.

```ruby
⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/room'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/house'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> house = House.new("$400000", "123 sugar lane")
⬜️ #=> #<House:0x00007fccd30375f8...>

⬜️ pry(main)> house.price
⬜️ #=> 400000

⬜️ pry(main)> house.address
⬜️ #=> "123 sugar lane"

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms
⬜️ #=> []

⬜️ pry(main)> room_1 = Room.new(:bedroom, 10, '13')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_2 = Room.new(:bedroom, 11, '15')    
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_1)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_2)    

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms
⬜️ #=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>]
```

## Iteration 3

Use TDD to update your `House` class so that it responds to the following interaction pattern.

There are **4** methods in iteration 3:

- [ ] A house is `#above_market_average?` if its price is greater than $500,000.
- [ ] A house can list its `#rooms_from_category` by taking a symbol of the room, and returning the instances of the matching rooms.
- [ ] A house can calculate its `#area` by adding together the areas of its rooms.
- [ ] A house's `#details` should return a Hash of its attributes (`price` and `address`).

```ruby
⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/room'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/house'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> house = House.new("$400000", "123 sugar lane")
⬜️ #=> #<House:0x00007fccd30375f8...>

⬜️ pry(main)> house.above_market_average?
⬜️ #=> false

⬜️ pry(main)> room_1 = Room.new(:bedroom, 10, '13')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_2 = Room.new(:bedroom, 11, '15')    
#=> #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_3 = Room.new(:living_room, 25, '15')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd383c2d0...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_4 = Room.new(:basement, 30, '41')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd297dc30...>

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_1)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_2)    

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_3)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_4)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms_from_category(:bedroom)
⬜️ #=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>]

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms_from_category(:basement)
⬜️ #=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd297dc30...>]

⬜️ pry(main)> house.area
⬜️ #=> 1900

⬜️ pry(main)> house.details
⬜️ #=> {"price" => 400000, "address" => "123 sugar lane"}
```

## Iteration 4

Use TDD to update your `House` class so that it responds to the following interaction pattern:

There are **3** methods in iteration 4:

- [ ] A house can calculate its `price_per_square_foot` by dividing its price by its area.
- [ ] A house can return a list of `rooms_sorted_by_area` where the `room` instances returned are listed from greatest area to least area.
- [ ] `#rooms_by_category` returns a hash where the keys are symbols of each room category, and the values are a collection of room instances that match the category.

```ruby
⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/room'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> require './lib/house'
⬜️ #=> true

⬜️ pry(main)> house = House.new("$400000", "123 sugar lane")
⬜️ #=> #<House:0x00007fccd30375f8...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_1 = Room.new(:bedroom, 10, '13')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_2 = Room.new(:bedroom, 11, '15')    
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_3 = Room.new(:living_room, 25, '15')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd383c2d0 @category=:living_room, @length=25, @width=15>

⬜️ pry(main)> room_4 = Room.new(:basement, 30, '41')
⬜️ #=> #<Room:0x00007fccd297dc30 @category=:basement, @length=30, @width=41>

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_4)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_1)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_3)

⬜️ pry(main)> house.add_room(room_2)    

⬜️ pry(main)> house.price_per_square_foot
⬜️ #=> 210.53

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms_sorted_by_area
⬜️ #=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd297dc30...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd383c2d0...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>]

⬜️ pry(main)> house.rooms_by_category
⬜️ #=> {:bedroom=>[#<Room:0x00007fccd29b5720...>, #<Room:0x00007fccd2985f48...>], :living_room=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd383c2d0...>], :basement=> [#<Room:0x00007fccd297dc30...>]}
```
